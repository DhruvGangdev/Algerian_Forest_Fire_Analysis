# Algerian Forest Fires Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting forest fires in Algeria using machine learning techniques. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of forest fire occurrences in Algeria, including meteorological and environmental features.

### Files
- **Algerian_forest_fires_dataset.csv**: The raw dataset containing fire occurrences and associated features.
- **Algerian_forest_fires_cleaned_dataset.csv**: The cleaned dataset after preprocessing.
- **EDA And FE Algerian Forest Fires.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing exploratory data analysis and feature engineering.
- **Model Training.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook for training machine learning models to predict forest fires.

## Steps Involved
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
